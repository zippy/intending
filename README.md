# Intending

Accounting for the world of deep wealth: start with intentions

## Overview

Intending is an application for mapping our intentions, what they are, and how we meet them.  Or you can think of it as as post-modern accounting for the age of digital distributed collective intelligence.

Instead of Accounts (categories) we declare intents (some times thought of as needs).  Instead of tracking the flow of funds between accounts, we track interactions that serve those intents and how as measured by a set of metrics.

Intents have dimensions: Urgency, Importance, Impact

Intents are organized as trees with the root being the global intent (i.e. joy/self-actualization/etc) and branch to sub intents that further specify how to achieve the parent intents i.e. body/mind/spirit, etc.

Intending replaces the "double-entry" of accounting, which was about prevention of corruption, with intrinsic data integrity through cryptographic signing (for basic data entry) and countersigning for multi-party interactions.

Instead of "transactions" intending has "interactions." Each interaction is about a "movement" in an intent, i.e. the meeting of a need that that intent fulfills.

## Status

This project is currently in conceptual development.  Code will appear here shortly.

## Ontology

### Intent

Name:text, relation to other intents:tree/path, Urgency:1-10, Importance:1-10

### Interaction

Intent: tree/path,  (if with other agent, their intent), Impact:1-10, Action: Metric/Value (i.e. quantity/amount/rating)

### Agent

Agent address

## Notes:
- privilege is the space to pay attention to important intents because the urgent ones are met
- viewing can rotate through dimensions
- viewing also against time, i.e. progress toward intentions
- different time horizons for some needs.  i.e. your stomach need filling fast.  your house needs repairing slowly.
- ascetics exemplify conscious control over action in the urgency/importance dimensions, i.e. rejecting commonly held notions of what's urgent for what they believe to be important.
- there's a map/model that's goal setting/budgeting, etc, and then there's the progress in meeting the goals.
- you can map territory you haven't achieved your intentions in.
